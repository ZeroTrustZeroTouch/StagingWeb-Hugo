blurb:
  heading: Human-Centric?
  text: During my time as a consultant I've had the fortune to interact with a
    large body of clients, and during these interactions I discovered that they
    are Humans too, with all the needs, strengths and flaws of any other
    Human.  What this means to me, is taking the time to understand not only the
    technical requirements, but also drive and motivation behind requests, so
    that I can present and discuss the options in a manor that everyone can
    understand and participate in the solution.

      Migrations:

      Are you moving Locations, Products, or Services? Upgrading Operating systems? Changing cloud providers?

      Modernization:

      This is a more involved, as it involves several discussions of existing solutions, a few user, staff, and stakeholder interviews to discover the current State of the Organization, the Desired state, and existing pain points.  Once that data is collected we can work together to reduce the pain points, and move towards the Desired State.  Typically this involves automating things like new user setups, software deployments, enabling SSO to reduce the number of separate passwords required for internal services.

      Consultation and Fractional Services:

      Consultation is basically anything else not covered already. Typically these would be initiative based, such as readying a cyber security plan, remediating insurance concerns, creating a patching or monitoring strategy.

values:
  heading: Our values
  text: At the end of the Day we're all Human. We strive to be clear,
    compassionate, and inclusive. Part of being compassionate includes selection
    of products, as such we try hard to utilize as many open products to
    maintain portability and reduce vendor lockin.
