  - heading: Human-Centric
    text: After many years of working in IT, I've recognized that at the end of the
      day all clients and service providers are Human. Being Human may sound
      like its a given, but over the years I've observed that so many offerings
      and communication packages end up going through layers and layers policies
      and procedures and turn the simplest offerings into dozens of pages.  I
      strive to provide clear and concise communications, statements of work,
      requirements and bring you simple, honest - Human-Centric offerings.
